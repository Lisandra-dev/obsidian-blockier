# Obsidian Blockier

A collection of small tools that make editing blocks (i.e. a paragraph, bullet point, etc) easier.

This plugin mostly fills feature gaps that I did not find in other plugins. I highly recommend that you also have a look at these:

## Other Recommended Plugins

- [Obsidian Outliner](https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-outliner) with "Enhance the Ctrl+A or Cmd+A behaviour" **disabled**.
- [Code Editor Shortcuts](https://github.com/timhor/obsidian-editor-shortcuts).
- Enabling "Move line down" and "Move line up" hotkeys (builtin).
- A theme that supports custom checkboxes/callouts, such as [AnuPpuccin](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin).
